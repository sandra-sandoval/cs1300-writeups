              <b>Overview</b>
              <br />
              When looking at current Period Tracking applications, it is clear
              that many have similar features aiming at giving their users a
              better understanding of their menstrual health. Over the past few
              years, however, users have become more concern with how their
              usage of these apps could be used against them. This pushed me to
              consider the social impacts of common features and design a period
              tracking app that accounts for them. I will develop a lo-fi mockup
              of a period tracking app that is user conscious and considers the
              ethical implications of its features.

              <br />
              While there are several social implications for common period app
              features, I want to specifically discuss and prioritize these
              issues in my design.

              <li>
                Poor structure: The order of the images (with the special
                signature image directly above the menu image) may cause
                confusion for the user in which image they should be looking at
                to get information about the drinks, toppings, and prices
                offered by Vivi Bubble Tea.

              <li>
                Layout: Navigation may not be very intuitive as the menu image
                is not the main or the largest image on the page.

            <div class="box">
              <h2 id="label">User Privacy</h2>
              <li>
                Due to the sensitive medical information that a period tracker
                Because period trackers track sensitive user health and medical
                information such as days in which the user is menstruating,
                ovulating, pregnant, and other sensitive reproductive health
                information, and thus, users will feel uncomfortable and
                violated if their data is accessed by third parties.
                Specifically, threats to user privacy could lead to
                <i>Discrimination</i>, <i>Commercial Exploitation</i>,
                <i>Legal Prosection</i>

              <h2 id="label">User Empowerment</h2>
              <li>
                Clutter : The order of the images reduces the pageâ€™s efficiency
                as users must seek the menu image that contains information
                about drinks, prices, and toppings from the others displayed on
                the screen.
              </li>
              <li>
                Ordering: There is no way to select an item from the page to
                place an order. Instead, the customer must type their wanted
                order onto a different page. This reduces efficiency as a
                customer will have to find their desired drink from another menu
                on a different page.

              <b>Design Choices</b>
              <br />
              <br />
              Taking the previously discussed social impacts of commonly seen
              features in period apps into account, I wanted to gear the
              features in my design into mitigating them as best as possible.
              <br />
              <br />
              In particular, there was a lot of discussion about the nudges that
              period apps give users that oftentimes influence their perspective
              and behavior. Therefore, some of the features that I have decided
              to implement in my design to mitigate the issue of paternalistic
              agendas include
            </p>
          </div>
          <div id="box-container">
            <div class="box" , id="feature">
              <p>Menstrual Education Section</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box" , id="feature">
              <p>Customizable Notifications</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box" , id="feature">
              <p>Customizable Symptom Tracking</p>

          </div>
          <div class="subsection" , id="iterative-subsection">
            <p>
              Further, privacy concerns has been a hot topic the past few years
              and thus, my design must ensure user privacy is protected as best
              as possible. Some features that aim at protecting user privacy
              include:
            </p>

          <div id="box-container">
