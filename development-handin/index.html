  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    I will be conducting a competitive analysis between different company
    websites to get a better sense of their strengths and weaknesses in regards
    to their aggregator function. Using this information, I will be implementing
    my own web app using React with an aggregator function that contains some of
    the features shown in the observed companies.
  </p>
  <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
  <p>
    For the sake of this analysis, I will be observing
    <a href="https://spotify.com/">Spotify</a>
    ,
    <a href="https://pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a>
    , and
    <a href="https://goodreads.com/">Goodreads</a>

    and their usage of aggregators in their favoriting functions
  </p>
  <p>For reference, this is what the interfaces look like</p>

    Based on the features I observed and compared between each website, I
    discovered some strengths and weaknesses for each one. For example,
    Spotify's greatest strengths are its clean and intuitive design and its
    filtering options based on mood and genre that appears at the top of the
    page. Spotify had a reasonable amount of sorting options such as Date,
    Title, Artist, and Album which are all relevant to its purpose as a music
    website. Still, these options were not overwhelming and therefore, did not
    leave to a cluttered and confusing design. Further, the mood filtering is a
    very helpful tool as it allows for users to find their music that best
    corresponds to their current state. Still, users lack complete freedom in
    organizing their music by their own choosing such as by ocassion due to
    Spotify's lack of an organization feature. This is Spotify's biggest
    weaknesses as it groups all Liked songs together which may lead to an
    unpleasant listening experience to the user due to different genres, moods,
    vibes, etc. being grouped together. This greatly affects the way a user will
    interact with their Liked songs since they will not be able to listen to it
    based on their customized order. While Spotify allows for users to organize
    songs through playlists and folders, Spotify has not implemented this
    feature to the Favorite playlist. Unlike Spotify's lack of organization in
    its Favorites Playlist, Pinterest's biggest strengths is its very
    customizable organization feature for saved pins through boards and
    sections. This gives the user much more creative freedom to visualize and
    plan out certain recipes, outfits, aesthetics, etc. and thus, leads to a
    more user-conscious experience. However, Pinterest's biggest weakness is its
    lack of a search bar which may become a problem for a user when dealing with
    a board with hundreds of pins. This affects the way the user will interact
    with their saved pins since they may need to look through each pin in their
    boards to find the specific one they are looking for. Furthermore, one of
    Goodreads biggest strengths was a feature that was not found in Spotify or
    Pinterest which is the bulk edit feature. This feature allows for bulk
    removal and addition to other shelves which makes navigation much easier for
    the user as it reduces reptitive actions being made. However, one of its
    weaknesses was its sorting options. While Goodreads' extensive sorting
    options allows for the user to have more freedom when searching for certain
    books, this also leads to a cluttered design and confusion for the user.
    Unlike Spotify's sorting options, Goodreads sorting options are not all
    relevant or useful for a user such as isbn, asin, or date pub (ed.). This is
    information that could perhaps be used for advance search, however having it
    as sort option makes the sorting feature much less intuitive.

    Based on my analysis of the features that worked best and those that did
    not, I plan to implement the following features:
    <li>Organization method</li>
    <li>In-search</li>
    <li>Different Display options (list, grid)</li>
    <li>Relevant Sorting Options</li>
