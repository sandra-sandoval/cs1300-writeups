    <h1>Responsive Redesign</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      I have chosen to redesign Vivi Bubble Tea Menu Page due to its poor
      performance when using the voice reader, its issues with low-contrast text
      in the headings, lack of alt descriptions on the images, and the ratio of
      the size of the images to the headings .
      <a href="https://vivibubbletea.com/menu/"
        >Vivi Bubble Tea Menu Page Link</a
      >
    </p>
    <!-- <p>Vivi Bubble Tea Menu Page Link: https://vivibubbletea.com/menu/</p> -->
    <img
      src="./assets/menu page.png"
      ,
      alt="Vivi Bubble Tea Menu"
      ,

      ,
      height="400"
      ,
    />
    <h2>Finding Problems</h2>
    <h3>Leanability</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Poor structure: The order of the images (with the special signature
        image directly above the menu image) may cause confusion for the user in
        which image they should be looking at to get information about the
        drinks, toppings, and prices offered by Vivi Bubble Tea.
      </li>
      <li>
        Layout: Navigation may not be very intuitive as the menu image is not
        the main or the largest image on the page.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Memorability</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Clutter: While the menu displayed on the web page serves as a good
        example of effective memorability due to its resemblance to real menus,
        the web page in its entirety does not as it contains several other
        redundant images that are displayed in a vertical manner, causing
        confusion.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Efficiency</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Clutter : The order of the images reduces the page’s efficiency as users
        must seek the menu image that contains information about drinks, prices,
        and toppings from the others displayed on the screen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ordering: There is no way to select an item from the page to place an
        order. Instead, the customer must type their wanted order onto a
        different page. This reduces efficiency as a customer will have to find
        their desired drink from another menu on a different page.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Other</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Low contrast text in the heading , makes it difficult for low vision
        users to view the page.
      </li>
      <li>
        Size of the ‘Special Signature’ is not properly scaled to the screen
        size, making navigation more difficult.
      </li>
      <li>
        Screen reader is unable to read the menu due to the menu being displayed
        inside images. Blind or low–vision users may not be able to access menu
        information (reduces efficiency)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
    <p>
      When running WebAIM WAVE on the web page, several issues regarding low
      contrast colors, empty links, and missing alternative text on images
      appeared. The issues that were flagged down by WebAIM WAVE are consistent
      with some of the issues I noticed as the contrast between the headings and
      the background made it a bit difficult to read. Further, WAVE detected
      missing or null alternative text on all images which means that customers
      with accessibility needs may be left without context about the images. As
      a result, these customers may be unable to access information about the
      menu options. When tested with a screen reader, the images were completely
      skipped due to the lack of alt text.
    </p>
    <h2>Speed Sketching</h2>
    <p>
      In 9 minutes, I sketched 9 different possible redesigns of Vivi Bubble Tea
      Menu Page
    </p>
    <img
      src="assets/Speed Sketches.png"
      ,
      alt="Speed sketches"
      ,
      width="800"
      ,
      height="600"
    />
    <h2>Final Sketch</h2>
    <p>
      Using my previous 9 speed sketches, I utilized some aspects of each
      design. to create a final sketch for my redesign
    </p>
    <img
      src="assets/FinalSketch.png"
      ,
      alt="final sketch"
      ,
      width="600px"
      ,
      height="500px"
    />
    <h2>Lo-fi Wireframes</h2>
    <p>
      Using the final sketch as a guide for the redesign, I have created three
      lo-fi wireframes of this design for different devices: desktop, tablet,
      and smart phone.
    </p>
    <h3>Desktop Lo-Fi wireframe</h3>
    <img src="assets/desktopLoFi.png" , width="700px" , height="500" />
    <h3>Tablet Lo-Fi wireframe</h3>
    <img src="assets/tabletLoFi.png" , width="600px" , height="700px" />
    <h3>Phone Lo-Fi wireframe</h3>
    <img src="assets/phoneLoFi.png" , width="500px" , height="750px" />
    <h2>Style Guide</h2>
    <p>
      To ensure consistency in my redesign of the Vivi Bubble Tea Menu page, I
      have created a Style Guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      This style guide consists of the logos, fonts, colors, drop shadow
      information, headers, and label information that is to be used for
      redesigning the page,
    </p>
    <img src="assets/style guide.png" , width="700px" , height="600px" />
    <h2>Hi-Fi Wireframes</h2>
    <p></p>
      Using my style guide and previously created lo-fi wireframes, I developed
      hi-fi wireframes for three different device types.
    </p>
    <h3>Desktop Wireframe</h3>
    <p>
      Note: This mockup consists of multiple desktop frames to get the feel of a
      scrolling effect to better fit the contents onto the page.
    </p>
    <img src="assets/desktopHi-Fi1.png" , width="450px" , height="800px" />
    <img src="assets/desktopHiFi2.png" , width="450px" , height="800px" />
    <h3>Tablet Wireframe</h3>
    <p>
      Note: This mockup consists of multiple desktop frames to get the feel of a
      scrolling effect to better fit the contents onto the page.
    </p>
    <img src="assets/tabletHiFi1.png" , width="350px" , height="800px" />
    <img src="assets/tabletHiFi2.png" , width="350px" , height="800px" />
    <img src="assets/tabletHiFi3.png" , width="350px" , height="800px" />
    <h3>Phone Wireframe</h3>
    <p>
      Note: This mockup consists of multiple desktop frames to get the feel of a
      scrolling effect to better fit the contents onto the page.
    </p>
    <img src="assets/PhotoHiFI.png" , width="800px" , height="900px" />
    <p>
      While the hi-fi mockups have the same components and styling, some
      adjustments had to be made with font sizes and placement of sections to
      ensure that the screen was not crowded. Further, the style guide I
      developed allowed for a consistent styling of the redesign among all three
      mockups.
    </p>

    <h2>Development</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      I have developed a redesigned page for Vivi Bubble Tea's menu to address
      the issues that I discussed previously. Using my Hi-Fi design and style
      guide, I created an html/css website to allow for improved learnability,
      memorability, and efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through media queries, I ensured that my design is accessible through
      every device.I tested my website's efficiency and accessibility through
      WebAIM, screen readers, google translate, and different zoom levels
    </p>
    <p>
      I ensured that the top-priority information is at the top of the page by
      implementing a scrolling menu. The photo gallery from the original design
      is placed at the bottom of the page. All these images contain alt labels for
      screen reader accessibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      The page can be accessed at
